    "task_description": "This is a comprehensive physics detector simulation workflow that combines literature analysis, computational modeling, and optimization. The task requires autonomously reading a scientific paper to extract experimental design specifications, then implementing a scaled-down computational simulation of the DarkSide-50 dark matter detector using GDML geometry modeling. The unique aspect is that it explicitly separates design extraction from performance measurement, requiring the user to discover detector characteristics through their own simulation rather than comparing against published results. The workflow includes GPU-constrained Monte Carlo particle simulations, performance characterization through light yield and signal analysis, and iterative optimization of detector geometry based on simulation findings.",
