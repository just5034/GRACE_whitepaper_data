The DarkSide-50 direct-detection dark matter experiment is a dual-phase argon time projection
chamber operating at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. This paper reports on the blind analysis
of a (16 660 ± 270) kg d exposure using a target of low-radioactivity argon extracted from under-
ground sources. We ﬁnd no events in the dark matter selection box and set a 90 % C.L. upper limit
on the dark matter-nucleon spin-independent cross section of 1.14 × 10−44 cm2 (3.78 × 10−44 cm2,
3.43 × 10−43 cm2) for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c2 (1 TeV/c2, 10 TeV/c2).

Despite much evidence from astronomy for dark
matter (DM),
years of laboratory and indirect
searches have yielded no experimental evidence for
DM that is not contradicted by other experiments.
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) re-
main a promising candidate for DM, but direct
searches are being pushed to probe lower WIMP-
nuclear interaction cross sections and to lower
(<10 GeV/c2) and higher (>1 TeV/c2) DM masses.
Probing lower cross sections requires higher sensi-
tivity and hence larger exposures (target mass×run
time),
and also,
as importantly,
more eﬃcient
background discrimination.
This issue is espe-
cially acute for spin-independent scattering for DM
masses above 10 GeV/c2, where current limits on the
WIMP-nucleon cross section are <10−44 cm2, reach-
ing as low as 4.1 × 10−47 cm2 at 30 GeV/c2 [1].

LAr TPCs have powerful pulse shape discrimination
(PSD) in the scintillation channel that separates
the nuclear recoils (NR) expected from WIMP
scattering from the electron recoil (ER) events
from the dominant β- and γ-induced backgrounds.
Exploiting this PSD, the single-phase DEAP-3600
LAr scintillation detector has recently reported
the best available DM-nucleon cross section limit
using an Ar target, 1.2 × 10−44 cm2 at a DM mass
of 100 GeV/c2,
from an initial 9.87 tonne-day
exposure [2].
In this paper, we report results from a 532.4-live-
day exposure of DarkSide-50, a LAr TPC with an
active mass of (46.4 ± 0.7) kg of low-radioactivity ar-
gon from underground sources (UAr) deployed in a
liquid-scintillator veto (LSV) for neutron and γ-ray
rejection and a water Cherenkov veto (WCV) for
shielding and muon detection. We report here the
most sensitive result to date with an argon target
and demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of this combina-
tion of detectors in rejecting a broad range of back-
grounds. This paper describes the techniques devel-
oped for a blind analysis of the 532.4-live-day data
set, which required detailed prediction of the back-
ground and deployment of new rejection methods.

I.
THE DARKSIDE-50 DETECTORS
The DarkSide-50 experiment is located in Hall C
of the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in
Italy, at a depth of 3800 m.w.e. [3].
The DarkSide-50 DM detector is a two-phase (liq-
uid and gas) argon TPC, described in Ref. [4] and
shown schematically in Fig. 1. Brieﬂy, a cylindri-
cal volume containing UAr is viewed through fused-
silica windows by top and bottom arrays of 19 3 ′′
Hamamatsu R11065 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
The windows are coated with Indium-Tin-Oxide
(ITO) which acts as the cathode (bottom) and anode
(top) of the TPC. The PMTs operate immersed in
LAr and are ﬁtted with cryogenic preampliﬁers [5].
The pre-ampliﬁers allow operation at reduced PMT
gain, taming breakdown issues in these PMTs.
LAr is boiled to form a 1 cm-thick gas pocket un-
der the anode window. A grid 4.7 mm beneath the
liquid-gas interface separates a 200 V/cm drift re-
gion in the main active volume from a higher-ﬁeld
extraction region.
The side wall of the active LAr volume is a Teﬂon
reﬂector. The inner surfaces of the Teﬂon reﬂector
and the windows are coated with tetraphenylbutadi-
ene (TPB), which shifts the 128 nm argon scintilla-
tion light to 420 nm, allowing transmission through
the windows and detection by the PMTs.
Interactions in the active volume result in ER or
NR events which produce primary scintillation (S1)
as well as ionization in the LAr.
Ionization elec-
trons surviving recombination at the event site are
drifted to the liquid-gas interface, where the extrac-
tion ﬁeld injects them into the gas region. In the
gas, the electric ﬁeld is large enough to cause the
electrons to produce a second signal (S2) by gas pro-
portional scintillation. S1 and S2 are both measured
with the PMT arrays. S1 (or, for higher resolution,
a linear combination of S1 and S2) measures energy;
the drift time (tdrift), the time between the detection
of S1 and S2, measures the vertical (z) location of
the event; and the pattern of S2 on the PMT arrays
measures the x and y coordinates of the event.
The DarkSide-50 veto system is described in de-
tail in Ref. [7]. The LSV is ﬁlled with 30 t of bo-
rated liquid scintillator that detects neutrons via
both prompt signals from thermalization and de-
layed signals from capture products. It detects neu-
trons producing NR in the LAr TPC with extremely
high eﬃciency (see Sec. V C) and also detects about
a third of the γ-rays giving ER in the TPC. The
LSV is surrounded by the 1 kt WCV, which pro-
vides shielding for the LSV and a veto for cosmic
ray muons. Radioactive calibration sources for the
characterization of the TPC and LSV are deployed
through the WCV and LSV to the side of the cryo-
stat using an articulated arm described in Ref. [8].
Under normal running conditions for the WIMP
search, all three detectors are read out upon a trig-
ger from the TPC that requires at least two PMTs
above a threshold of 0.6 PE [5]. Much of the data re-
ported here also includes 0.05 Hz of pulser-generated
triggers, which provides an unbiased sample of detec-
tor baselines and signals. Timestamps are recorded
with the data from each detector to allow later syn-
chronization.
II.
DATA DESCRIPTION AND
CALIBRATION
Data are recorded from the TPC and both vetoes
with each trigger. TPC data contains the waveforms
from the 38 PMTs, digitized at 250 MHz without
zero suppression [5].
The digitized waveforms are
acquired in a single 440 µs window, beginning 5 µs
before the trigger time and long enough to include
S1 and S2, given the maximum electron drift time of
376 µs. Data from each PMT in both vetoes are digi-
tized at 1.25 GHz and zero suppressed with a thresh-
old of ∼0.25 PE. Veto data are recorded in a 200 µs
window beginning 10.5 µs before the initiating TPC
trigger [9].
A.
Reconstruction
Low-level reconstruction of TPC events follows
the steps described in Ref. [4]. The digitized PMT
waveforms that make up the raw data are analyzed
using darkart, a code based on the Fermi National
4
Accelerator Laboratory art framework [10], which
identiﬁes pulses with area ≳10 PE in the acquisition
window. Timing and integral information are cal-
culated for each pulse. While pulse-ﬁnding is done
on the veto data, the WIMP search uses only in-
tegrals over pre-speciﬁed regions of interest (ROI),
described in V A 4.
Of particular interest is the TPC PSD parameter
f90, deﬁned as the fraction of S1 light detected in
the ﬁrst 90 ns of a pulse. This parameter allows very
strong pulse shape discrimination between NR and
ER [11], as demonstrated in practice in our previous
work [4].
In the current analysis, we perform radial ﬁducial-
ization using transverse (x-y) reconstruction.
We
did not do so in previous DarkSide-50 analyses,
as reconstruction of the x-y position of events in
DarkSide-50 proved to be very diﬃcult [12, 13]. This
is believed to be due to the proximity of the top
PMTs to the S2-emission region, which limits charge
sharing among the 3 ′′ PMTs.
The (x-y) position
reconstruction algorithm used here [12] starts with
maps constructed from Monte Carlo events of the
simulated light response for each PMT vs. the true
position. Atmospheric argon data [4], dominated by
uniformly-distributed 39Ar decays, are used to it-
erate the maps to account for features in data not
modeled in the Monte Carlo. For a given event in the
data, the algorithm compares the measured pattern
of S2 light with the maps, ﬁnding the position that
gives the best agreement. The position resolution
is estimated to be about 0.6 cm from the observed
spatial separation of events tagged as a delayed co-
incidence of 214Bi-214Po decays. These events were
distributed across the full volume and had an S2
signal size of about 20 × 103 PE. In the absence of
any internal calibration sources with known location,
we found no reliable way to calibrate the resolution
vs. the absolute position. We discuss how we dealt
with this situation to estimate the rejection and ac-
ceptance of the radial cut in Secs. V E and V F.
After reconstruction, data are stored in a ROOT
format [14]. This is summarized in a secondary out-
put called SLAD (for SLim Analysis Data), with
event and pulse information for further study by an-
alyzers. Separate SLAD are made for the TPC and
veto data. These are then matched event-by-event
using the timestamps in each data stream.
B.
Calibration
The single-photoelectron (SPE) response of each
PMT in the TPC and vetoes is determined by inject-
ing low-light-level laser pulses into the detector vol-
umes via optical ﬁbers. The SPE means and widths
are determined in the TPC and vetoes as described
in [4, 9, 15].
The S1 light yield is measured using 83mKr intro-
duced into the recirculating argon [16]. The 83mKr
decays to 83Kr in two sequential transitions, where
the second transition has a mean-life of 222 ns and
thus is usually reconstructed as part of S1. This pro-
vides a monoenergetic signal in the TPC that is also
used to calibrate the S1 signal z-dependence and the
S2 signal radial dependence as described in [4, 17].
The zero-ﬁeld UAr photoelectron yield at the TPC
center, measured at the 41.5 keV
83mKr peak, is
(8.0 ± 0.2) PE/keV. 83mKr campaigns taken at var-
ious times during the running period indicate that
it remained stable within ∼0.4 %.
While we use S1 as our primary energy variable
in the WIMP search, the sharing of deposited en-
ergy between scintillation and ionization in a TPC
makes a combination of S1 and S2 a more lin-
ear and higher-resolution energy variable [18, 19].
We use such a variable for the determination of
background-generating radioactivity in the detector
– see Sec. III D. The combined S1-S2 ER energy scale
is established by reconstructing γ-ray lines from
trace radioactivity in detector components. These
lines at higher energies consist of multiple Comp-
ton scattering events, requiring special techniques
to deal with events with multiple S2 pulses [18].
We construct the nuclear recoil energy scale from
the S1 signal using the photoelectron yield of NRs
of known energy measured in the SCENE experi-
ment [20, 21], via the procedure described in Ref. [4].
Brieﬂy, SCENE measures the ratio of NR yield at
200 V/cm to that of 83mKr at zero ﬁeld. Our zero-
ﬁeld photoelectron yield for 83mKr then gives the NR
PE yield vs. S1 in DarkSide-50. We assume constant
NR PE yield above the highest SCENE-measured
energy, 57.3 keVnr.
Initial operations of DarkSide-50 with atmo-
spheric argon (AAr) [4] provided a large sample
of
39Ar β decays.
This data set of uniformly-
distributed, single-sited ER events is used as our
primary calibration of f90 (see Sec. V E).
Coincident γ rays from 60Co decays in the cryo-
stat steel are used to determine the LSV light yield
and to measure the time-oﬀset between the TPC and
LSV signals. Cosmic-ray muons align the timing of
the WCV with the other detectors.
241AmBe neutron calibrations are used to deter-
mine the f90 distribution for NR. 241AmBe NR can-
didates are selected by requiring a single-sited TPC
event in prompt coincidence with an LSV signal con-
sistent with a 4.4 MeV γ ray from the source. The
f90 distributions for each S1 bin in this data sample
are ﬁtted with an analytic model based on a modi-
ﬁed ratio-of-two-Gaussians treatment [22, 23]. This
5
analytic model is used only for calculating the ac-
ceptance of the ﬁnal f90 vs. S1 WIMP search box
(see Sec. V F).
241AmBe calibrations are used to establish the
heavily-quenched visible energy of the neutron cap-
tures on 10B that give the LSV its high eﬃciency for
captures [7]. Coincident γ rays preclude the use of
241AmBe for calibrating the prompt neutron ther-
malization signal in the LSV.
For this we use an
241Am13C source [24] with a thin degrader that re-
duces the α energy below that needed to reach the
lowest excited state of 16O. With lead shielding to
absorb the 241Am x-rays, this results in a neutron
source very low in coincident γ rays, allowing study
of isolated neutrons (see Sec. V C).
C.
Data Set
The data set reported in this paper consists of
532.4 live-days of UAr data taken from August 2,
2015, to October 4, 2017. It does not include the
data reported in Ref. [17]. Aside from TPC laser
calibration runs (typically taken several times per
day and lasting ∼5 min) and occasional calibration
campaigns (83mKr, 241AmBe, and 241Am13C, last-
ing a few days to a few weeks), data were taken
continuously in DM-search mode, and running con-
ditions were very uniform throughout this period.
Data were usually divided into runs of 6-hour dura-
tion.
The trigger rate varied from 1.3 Hz to 1.7 Hz due
to intermittent bipolar noise spikes generated by a
high-voltage power supply. These spikes were com-
pletely removed by our baseline-ﬁnding software,
leaving a residual rate of 1.2 Hz mostly due to γ rays
from detector materials and 85Kr and residual 39Ar
in the UAr [17].
Blinded data (see Sec. IV) were checked run-by-
run for hardware and software issues that warranted
run removal.
The main causes were oscillations
in veto-channel front end electronics (34.3 live-days)
and abnormal baseline noise in TPC PMT sig-
nals (16.2 live-days), with smaller losses from runs
shorter than 1000 events (∼10 min duration), in-
dividual TPC PMTs breaking down or emitting
light, and other causes.
After eliminating these
runs,
the
total
livetime
of
the
data
set
was
545.6 live-days.
This is reduced further by event
quality cuts and the veto cut against cosmic ray ac-
tivation (see Sec. V and Table V) to our ﬁnal live-
time of 532.4 live-days.
With our ﬁducial mass of
(31.3 ± 0.5) kg (see Sec. V F), the exposure reported
here is (16 660 ± 270) kg d.

Two corrections are applied to S1.
The ﬁrst corrects
for ADC saturation, and the second corrects for the z-
dependence of the light yield [25]. The 222Rn and 218Po
peaks are ﬁtted with Gaussian+exponential functions,
and the energy scale at the top of the plot is set by the
218Po peak [26]. The 210Po is ﬁtted with a Crystal Ball
function, the shape of which suggests that the 210Po is
on the surface beneath the TPB.
III.
BACKGROUND SOURCES AND
MITIGATION
Processes that provide backgrounds to the DM
search fall into two main categories. The ﬁrst cate-
gory consists of α decays and neutrons, which yield
NR or NR-like signals strongly resembling DM scat-
ters. The second category consists of ER-inducing
processes, primarily β decays and γ-ray interactions,
that, although more copious, are suppressed by the
powerful PSD in LAr. In this section we describe
the major background categories and our mitigation
strategies. The background rejection levels achieved
and the levels of background expected in the ﬁnal
sample after all cuts are given in Sec. V.
A.
α Decays
For α decays in the active LAr, or on or very near
surfaces touching it, both the α itself and the re-
coiling daughter nuclide give NR-like f90. Given the
highly radiopure materials selected for construction
of the TPC, the α emitters of interest are primarily
radon daughters either deposited on detector sur-
faces during fabrication and assembly or introduced
into the circulating LAr during the experiment.
We have seen and studied both surface and bulk-
LAr α events in DarkSide-50 [26], with an energy
spectrum shown in Fig. 2.
The measured spe-
ciﬁc activities of 222Rn and 218Po in the LAr are
(2.12 ± 0.04) µBq/kg and (1.55 ± 0.03) µBq/kg, re-
spectively [26]. α decays in the bulk LAr give sharp
peaks in S1 which are far outside the DM NR en-
6
ergy range, leaving surface events to contend with
as background.
The major source of surface background is 210Pb-
supported 210Po decays. With the full-energy 210Po
α’s outside the DM-search energy range, the poten-
tial background sources are either α’s degraded in
energy or events with the daughter 206Pb atom re-
coiling directly into the LAr. The broad lineshape
of the 210Po signals identiﬁed in Ref. [26] and shown
in Fig. 2 gives clear evidence for degraded α events.
The recoiling atoms alone would not produce enough
light in the LAr to be a background, but simultane-
ous α scintillation in the TPB can boost the event
into the DM search region [27].
Surface events on the cathode and grid are easily
rejected by drift time cuts (z ﬁducialization). The
observed rate of 210Po α’s on the ∼0.4 m2 side reﬂec-
tor is (2.51 ± 0.01) mBq/m2. Section V B discusses
several characteristics of surface events, beyond their
radial location, that allow them to be rejected.
B.
Neutrons
Individual elastic scatters of neutrons in the
LAr are indistinguishable from DM-induced scat-
ters, making these a critical background. Consider-
able eﬀorts in DarkSide-50 were devoted to reducing
and suppressing neutron background, most notably
stringent materials selection and the development of
the veto system.
Neutrons are produced by cosmic-ray muons in-
teracting in the rock and other materials surround-
ing the experiment (cosmogenic) and by trace ra-
dioactivity of detector materials (radiogenic). Many
neutron-induced events can be rejected because, un-
like DM particles, the neutrons are very likely to
interact multiple times in our detectors.
Multiple
interactions in a single TPC event are detected by
resolving multiple S2 pulses. Both cosmogenic and
radiogenic neutrons leaving WIMP-like signatures in
the TPC also leave signals in the LSV with high
probability, allowing them to be rejected with high
eﬃciency. (See Sec. V C for details.) Additional re-
jection in the TPC comes from ﬁducialization (again
due to the relatively short neutron interaction length
in LAr), and from requiring S1 to lie in the WIMP
search range. The WCV gives additional rejection
of cosmogenic events.
Radiogenic neutrons come from spontaneous ﬁs-
sion of 238U and from (α,n) interactions, where the
α’s come from uranium and thorium chain activity.
In DarkSide-50, the spontaneous ﬁssion events are
easily rejected due to the high LSV eﬃciency for
neutrons and moderate eﬃciency for γ rays, com-
bined with the average neutron multiplicity for 238U
spontaneous ﬁssion of 2.01 and the high γ-ray mul-
tiplicity.
This leaves (α,n) as the main source of
potential radiogenic neutron background.
Our (α,n) calculations [28], normalized to the as-
sayed construction materials activities described in
Sec. III D, indicate that the dominant sources of
neutron production in the TPC and cryostat are
the PMTs and a viton o-ring in the outer cryostat
ﬂange. For neutrons that reach the TPC and give
single-scatter NR-like events in the ﬁducial volume,
Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations (G4DS) [29]
indicate that the o-ring contribution is negligible,
and the PMTs, speciﬁcally the borosilicate-glass
“stem” and the ceramic plates that hold the dyn-
odes, are the source of >90 % of the radiogenic neu-
tron background in the TPC.
C.
β Decays and γ Rays
The WCV and LSV provide eﬃcient passive
shielding against β’s and γ rays originating outside
the TPC cryostat, leaving the cryostat and TPC
components (including the LAr) as the only im-
portant sources of β/γ-induced background.
Ar-
gon derived from the atmosphere (AAr) contains
∼1 Bq/kg of cosmic-ray produced 39Ar activity [30,
31].
39Ar is a β emitter and dominated the trig-
ger rate and background in DarkSide-50 when it
was ﬁlled with AAr [4]. The DarkSide collaboration
has identiﬁed, extracted, and puriﬁed argon from
underground sources (UAr) [32–34] that has only
(0.73 ± 0.11) mBq/kg of 39Ar activity [17]. The use
of UAr drastically reduces the ER background in
DarkSide-50. Even including the 1.9 ± 0.1 mBq/kg
of 85Kr found in the current DarkSide-50 UAr ﬁll [17,
corrected for the 15.5-y mean life], the dominant
source of ER background is Compton scatters of
γ rays from the TPC and cryostat.
PSD via f90 is the major rejector of γ-induced
ER. In Ref. [4] we showed that PSD with f90 re-
jected the single-sited ER events from 39Ar decay to
a level of one in 1.5 × 107. Unlike the ER events from
39Ar, γ-induced events are often multi-sited and are
not uniformly distributed, so requiring single-scatter
events and ﬁducializing give additional suppression.
Many γ-induced events in the TPC are in prompt
coincidence with additional interactions in the LSV,
giving further rejection.
The fundamental limitation on PSD removing
single-sited ER scintillation events is at low energies,
where photoelectron statistics limit rejection. How-
ever, among γ-ray-induced events, there are some
in which a γ ray multiple-Compton scatters, scat-
tering once in the active LAr and also in a nearby
Cherenkov radiator such as the Teﬂon reﬂector or
7
the fused silica windows of the TPC or PMTs. The
all-prompt Cherenkov light adds to the prompt com-
ponent of the normal ER-like S1 and can give a
NR-like f90. As discussed in Sec. V E, these mixed
scintillation+Cherenkov events, hints of which had
already appeared in Ref. [17], prove to be the dom-
inant background in the experiment.
D.
Determination of Activities in Detector
Materials
The γ-ray- and neutron-induced backgrounds
originate primarily in the trace radioactivity of de-
tector components. The DarkSide collaboration car-
ried out an extensive program of assays to select ra-
diopure materials and to understand their residual
activities. Our background estimates are based on
a radioactivity model that starts with the results
of the assays.
However, due to a late-developing
need to use R11065 PMTs instead of the planned
lower-activity R11065-20s, we do not have assays of
the PMTs installed in DarkSide-50, but rather only
a single measurement of three R11065s from early
production batches.
For this reason, activities in the PMTs are esti-
mated by ﬁtting spectra generated by Monte Carlo
from activities in various detector locations to a re-
constructed TPC energy spectrum [18, 35].
Since
the actual construction materials used for the cryo-
stat components (stainless steel body, ﬂanges, nuts,
bolts, pipes/feedthroughs, Viton o-ring, multi-layer
insulation) were assayed, their respective activities
in the ﬁtting process are ﬁxed to the assayed values.
The 39Ar and 85Kr in the LAr are ﬁxed to their val-
ues as reported in [17], with the 85Kr corrected for
its decay since that measurement.
We consider the activities of these isotopes in the
PMTs:
60Co, 40K, 232Th, 235U, and 238U (allow-
ing secular equilibrium to be broken, with 226Ra as
the top of the lower chain). The main hosts of ra-
dioactivity in the PMTs are the borosilicate glass
stem at the back of the PMT, the ceramic insu-
lators supporting the dynodes, and the Kovar cas-
ing. Comparing the results of assays of the ceramic
insulators, a Kovar casing, and various versions of
whole R11065 PMTs, the fraction of each activity
in each PMT component was inferred, and we ﬁt
the summed PMT activities keeping these fractions
ﬁxed.
The ﬁt is done iteratively, estimating the PMT
activities by taking advantage of certain high-energy
γ rays unique to individual decay chains. 232Th ac-
tivity in the PMTs is estimated ﬁrst by ﬁtting the
2.6 MeV 208Tl peak, where the contribution from
the other decay chains is low. 232Th activity is then

one free parameter to preserve their natural abun-
dance ratio. The activity estimates from this proce-
dure are presented in Table I and the resulting en-
ergy spectrum is shown in Fig. 3. We note that leav-
ing 85Kr and 39Ar free in the ﬁt along with 235U and
238Uup returns signiﬁcantly diﬀerent rate estimates
for these four decay chains; however, switching be-
tween the rates so-obtained and those presented in
Table I has no impact on the predicted background
in the WIMP search region. Note as well that, while
the WIMP-search region is far to the left in Fig. 3,
the thorium and lower uranium chains, ﬁtted to the
right side of the plot, are the main contributors to
Cherenkov radiation, from electrons scattered by the
high energy γ rays, and neutrons, produced by high
energy α’s.
The uncertainty on the PMT background activity
from a given chain is estimated by propagating the
uncertainty on the measured cryostat activity in that
chain. (The uncertainties from the ﬁt are negligible.)
In particular, the uncertainties on 60Co, 40K, 232Th,
and 238Ulow, the main contributors to Cherenkov
background due to their high energy γ rays, are es-
timated to be <13%.
IV.
BLINDING SCHEME
We performed a blind analysis on the 532.4-live-
day data set.
This means that candidate selec-
tion/background rejection was designed, and the
background surviving cuts was estimated, without
knowledge of the number or properties of events in
the ﬁnal search region.
Blindness was imposed by a “Blinding Module”

in SLAD. An unblinded SLAD was produced ﬁrst
and kept in a protected directory. Then the SLAD
program operated on it with the Blinding Module
to produce the blinded, analyzer’s version. Blinded
events appear in the output ﬁles, but with all TPC
data except the event ID, timestamps, and the live-
time associated with the event set to −1.
In the
initial blinding, used through most of the analysis,
details of two categories of events were hidden from
users. The ﬁrst category consisted of events with S1
and f90 falling within the “blinding box”, shown in
Fig. 4 superimposed on the published data set from
Ref. [17] before any analysis cuts. The blinding box
was designed to be larger than any expected ﬁnal
WIMP-search box and to be just above the main ER
band. It was applied to all events, even those that
failed major analysis cuts (e.g., single-pulse events,
events with multiple S2’s, etc.). The second category
consisted of events randomly chosen with a proba-
bility of 2 × 10−5. The random fraction was chosen
to have enough ﬂuctuations to obscure the count-
ing of possible candidate events in the ﬁnal analysis
stages, where it was anticipated that the number of
candidates would be small or zero when ﬁnal cuts
were applied.
Besides the events outside the blinding box, open
data available to analyzers included the large AAr
data set [4], the initial 70.9-live-day UAr data
set [17], laser calibration data, and all data from
campaigns with calibration sources present. During
the analysis, we opened sections of the blinded data
outside of the WIMP search region to provide sam-
ples enriched in particular backgrounds for study,
and later, when the background predictions were
mature, to test the predictions.

V.
BACKGROUND ESTIMATION AND
REJECTION
The goal of the blind analysis is to design a set of
criteria that rejects background to a pre-determined
level without prior inspection of events in the ﬁnal
search region (the “box”), which itself must be de-
signed as part of the analysis procedure. We choose
0.1 event of expected background as an acceptable
level, giving a <10% Poisson probability of seeing
one or more background events in the search box.
A.
Event selection
As in earlier DarkSide-50 analyses, the initially-
dominant ER background and the power of LAr PSD
suggest an analysis structured around the f90 vs. S1
distribution.
We thus choose the design of the
f90 vs. S1 box as the ﬁnal analysis step, after all
other cuts are deﬁned.
We began with the set of analysis cuts developed
for earlier analyses [4, 17]. Some of these cuts were
modiﬁed for this analysis, and some new ones were
developed – the new or modiﬁed cuts are indicated
with asterisks. We introduce all the cuts here with
brief descriptions; the full set is listed in the accep-
tance table, Table V. The motivations for some of
the cuts will be elaborated on in the sections de-
scribing the relevant backgrounds.
1.
Event quality cuts
AllChan: data are present for all TPC channels in
the event.
Baseline: baselines for the digitized waveforms are
successfully found in all TPC channels.
9
VetoPresent: the event has GPS-timestamp-matched
veto data.
TimePrev*: the event occurs at least 400 µs after
the end of the inhibit window of the previous trigger
(that is, at least 1.21 ms after the previous trigger).
This removes events that triggered on an S2 whose
S1 occurred during the inhibit window.
2.
Basic TPC event cuts
These cuts are designed to ensure that passing
events are single-scatter events that triggered on S1
and have a single valid S2.
S1start: the ﬁrst pulse occurs at trigger time.
Npulse: there is a second pulse, presumed to be S2.
A third pulse is allowed only if its timing is consis-
tent with the small tertiary pulses produced when
S2 light photoionizes the TPC cathode.
S1sat: the ﬁrst pulse does not saturate the digitizers.
MinS2uncorr*: the second pulse is required to be
≥200 PE before position-based corrections, the ap-
proximate threshold for successful reconstruction of
the event’s radial position. For reference, the uncor-
rected S2’s of interest in this analysis are >400 PE.
S2f90:
the second pulse has f90<0.20, consistent
with the slow rise-time of S2 pulses.
xyRecon: the x-y reconstruction algorithm success-
fully derives transverse coordinates of the event from
S2.
MinS2/S1: a more reﬁned S2 cut that removes events
with unphysically small S2/S1. The cut is set to re-
move events in the lowest 1% of the S2/S1 distribu-
tion of 241AmBe NRs.
3.
Surface background cuts
These cuts were all developed for the current anal-
ysis [26]. They are described in Sec. V B.
LongS1tail*:
removes events with S1 with a long
tail, consistent with laboratory measurements of α-
induced scintillation in TPB wavelength shifter.
MaxS2/S1*: removes events in the highest 1% of the
S2/S1 distribution of 241AmBe NRs. This cut tar-
gets the “Type 2” surface background with uncorre-
lated S1 and S2 described in Sec. V B. This can also
be a powerful discriminant between NR and ER and
is the basis of WIMP discrimination in LXe TPCs.
In LAr TPC’s it is eﬀective against high-energy ERs,
but it is not eﬀective at low S1, where further rejec-
tion is most needed.
S2LEshape*: removes events in which the shape of
the leading edge of the second pulse is not consistent
with the shape of a true S2 pulse [36].
S1TBA*: removes events with a z location deter-
mined from the S1 top-bottom asymmetry that is
not consistent with the z location determined from
S2 via tdrift.
4.
Neutron background cuts
The neutron veto cuts are essentially unchanged
from the ﬁrst UAr analysis [7, 17].
LSVprompt: rejects events with >1 PE in the interval
[-50,250] ns relative to the TPC trigger time. This
targets the thermalization signal from neutrons giv-
ing NR in the TPC.
LSVdelayed: rejects events with >6 PE in a 500 ns
sliding window covering [0,189.5] µs after a TPC
trigger. This interval can be compared to the cap-
ture lifetime of 22 µs in the boron-loaded liquid scin-
tillator.
The long acquisition window and search
interval allow us to veto eﬃciently via the emitted
γ rays even when the neutron captures in TPC ma-
terials with long capture lifetimes.
LSVpre: rejects events with >3 PE in a 500 ns sliding
window covering [−10.5,0] µs before a TPC interac-
tion.
CosmicMu:
rejects events with a WCV signal
>400 PE or an LSV signal >2000 PE, integrated
over the full 200 µs acquisition window. This vetos
cosmic-ray muons or their showers and thus cosmo-
genic neutrons.
CosmoActiv*: a“cosmic ray activation veto” is ap-
plied if a TPC event occurs within 0.6 s (shorter than
in previous analyses) following a triggered event fail-
ing the CosmicMu cut. This removes some delayed
neutrons produced by cosmic-ray-activated isotopes
in the detectors.
5.
ER background cuts
PSD via f90 is the primary discriminant against
ER backgrounds and is used to deﬁne the ﬁnal
WIMP search box via the procedure discussed in
Sec. V E. We found in this analysis that scintilla-
tion+Cherenkov events dominated the tail of the
f90 distribution near the WIMP search region. They
thus determined the search box needed to reduce the
total background to <0.1 event in the full exposure.
The other cuts aimed at scintillation+Cherenkov
and other ER events are discussed here.
tdrift: vertical ﬁducialization via the time between
S1 and S2 (tdrift) is eﬀective against γ rays from the
PMTs, their primary source. We use the same ver-
tical ﬁducialization as in the previous analyses, re-
moving 40 µs of drift time (∼4 cm) from the top and

bottom of the active volume. Though the ER back-
ground determined the location of the cut, it is also
clearly important for surface background, notably
serving to eliminate α decays occurring on the TPC
cathode and grid.
S1pMaxFrac*: for “S1 prompt maximum fraction”,
removes events with S1 too concentrated in any one
PMT. These events are likely to have interactions
giving Cherenkov light in the fused silica PMT and
TPC windows.
A variant of this cut was used in
past analyses, but it was modiﬁed for the current
analysis to use only prompt light, boosting its ef-
fectiveness as a Cherenkov discriminant. This cut
is extremely eﬀective against fused silica Cherenkov,
leaving scintillation+Cherenkov in the Teﬂon reﬂec-
tor as the main surviving ER background.
S1NLL*: squeezes further rejection from the S1 PMT
pattern, targeting the multi-sited nature of scintil-
lation+Teﬂon Cherenkov events. The pattern of S1
light on the PMT arrays is required to be consistent
with the reconstructed x-y position via a negative-
log-likelihood comparison to templates derived from
AAr data (dominated by single-sited 39Ar β decays).
RadialFid*:
a radial ﬁducial cut.
The radial cut
is a drift-time-dependent radial contour chosen to
reject a ﬁxed fraction of G4DS-simulated scintilla-
tion+Teﬂon Cherenkov events (see Sec. V E) in each
drift time bin. The ﬁnal cut varies from ∼23 mm
from the wall at the top and bottom of the TPC to
∼4 mm from the wall at the center.
The eﬀect of the radial cut is shown in Fig. 5,
made after unblinding. The events (primarily ER
background from PMT and cryostat γ rays, includ-
ing mixed scintillation+Cherenkov events) are seen
to be concentrated near the top and sides of the de-
tector as expected. Despite the limitations of the re-
construction algorithm, the concentration of events
and the impact of the cut are clear.
B.
Surface events
Alphas coming from isotopes embedded in detec-
tor surfaces exhibit a degraded energy spectrum and
can fall within the energy and f90 regions of inter-
est, as can the recoiling nucleus in an α decay [27].
We ﬁnd that the S2 signal for surface events in
DarkSide-50 is heavily suppressed, possibly due to
loss of drifting electrons very close to the side reﬂec-
tor of the TPC. Few surface events have an S2 that
is large enough to pass analysis cuts, with the ma-
jority having no discernible S2 pulse. We call these
“S1-only” events.
We therefore consider two cases for a surface decay
to become a background event. Type 1: the rare case
of a surface event with a true S2 that passes analysis
cuts. Type 2: an S1-only event that happens to oc-
cur before an uncorrelated “S2-only” event such that
the combination appears to be a regular event with
one S1 and one S2.
We estimate the background
rates of these two cases separately.
Type 1: In the open data with S1>600 PE, sur-
face events only pass S2 analysis cuts at energies far
above the region of interest (S1>20 000 PE) due to
the low electron collection eﬃciency along the side
wall, with an acceptance that declines with decreas-
ing S1.
Extrapolating this eﬀect into the WIMP
search region and applying it to the observed rate of
S1-only events, we estimate that <0.07 such events
could pass the S2 analysis cuts.
Further reduction of Type 1 surface background
is achieved by using the layer of TPB deposited on
detector surfaces as a veto. It was discovered that
alphas passing through TPB induce millisecond-long
scintillation in the wavelength shifter [37]. The pres-
ence of this slow component following an S1 pulse
tags the event as originating from a TPB-coated sur-
face. We count the individual photoelectrons in the
region between S1 and S2 and deﬁne a cut based on
this count, LongS1tail, that accepts 99% of 241AmBe
NR events. Applying the cut to a sample of surface
decays obtained in Ref. [37] results in a rejection
factor of more than 100, giving an expectation of
<0.0007 Type 1 surface background events in the
current data set.
Additional rejection is expected
from the RadialFid and MinS2uncorr cuts, which is
diﬃcult to estimate and not included in the back-
ground estimate.
Type 2: True S2-only events are rare, but appar-
ent S2-only events are present in the form of ordinary
events near the top of the detector. In these events,
S1 and S2 can be so close in time (tdrift ≲3 µs) that
they are not resolved by our reconstruction.
The
real or apparent S2-only events and S1-only surface
events are uncorrelated and of constant rate, allow-
ing the use of Poisson statistics to predict the ex-

pected number of S1+S2 pileup background events.
We mitigate Type 2 background by imposing three
additional requirements on the apparent S2 signal.
The ﬁrst is the maximum S2/S1 cut, MaxS2/S1,
which removes events with S2/S1 larger than 99%
of 241AmBe NR events of the same S1.
This cut
targets S1-only events with an accidental S2 either
augmented by an unresolved S1 or simply uncorre-
lated with S1. The second, S2LEshape, removes un-
resolved S1 and S2 by requiring that the apparent S2
pulse have the ∼2 µs risetime of a true S2 pulse [36]
rather than the few-ns risetime of S1. This S2 shape
cut is applied via the ratio of the integrals of the
ﬁrst 90 ns and ﬁrst 1µs of the S2 pulse. The third,
S1TBA, removes events with S1 and S2 pulses that
originate from diﬀerent positions. We require that
the z positions inferred from the top-bottom asym-
metry in the detected S1 light and from tdrift diﬀer
by no more than 3σ, as determined from uniform
39Ar events from AAr. These last two cuts are each
designed to have >99% acceptance for nuclear re-
coils. After application of these additional cuts, we
expect 0.00092 ± 0.00004 surviving Type 2 surface
background events in the current data set.
C.
Radiogenic neutrons
The estimate of radiogenic neutron background
starts with a direct measurement of the LSV ef-
ﬁciency for detecting neutrons that leave WIMP-
like signatures in the TPC. We do this with the
241Am13C source (see Sec. II B) deployed just out-
side the TPC cryostat.
241Am13C calibration data
are taken in the same trigger conﬁguration as nor-
mal WIMP-search data, with the TPC triggering
both vetoes. The standard WIMP analysis is run
to ﬁnd NR candidates in a preliminary version of
the f90 vs. S1 WIMP-search box. The neutron veto
eﬃciency is then calculated as the fraction of TPC
NR candidates that fail the standard WIMP-search
LSV cuts described in Sec. V A 4. From a sample of
about 25,000 events that pass TPC NR cuts, we ﬁnd
the veto eﬃciencies shown in Table II. Radiogenic-
neutron background events diﬀer from 241Am13C-
neutron events in their origin point and energy spec-
trum, but Monte-Carlo simulations indicate a higher
veto eﬃciency for radiogenic events; we do not apply
that correction here.

nal unblinding was the “Veto Prompt Tag” (VPT)
sample, which unblinded any event that failed the
LSVprompt cut. The high neutron eﬃciency of the
prompt cut allows radiogenic neutron events to be
counted directly in the VPT sample. The narrow
integration window of the LSV-prompt cut means
that, even with its 1 PE threshold, the accidental
tagging rate is <1% (see Table V). Thus the VPT
tag accidentally accepts practically no real WIMP
events, and γ-induced events are the only back-
ground to a neutron count using the VPT sample.
To get a sample of conﬁrmed neutron events from
the VPT sample, we use a modiﬁed version of the
LSV-delayed cut.
The modiﬁcation is needed for
two reasons: the sliding window used for the LSV-
delayed cut overlaps the LSV-prompt window (al-
beit with a higher threshold), and the LSV has a
high rate of PMT afterpulses, so the delayed region
is heavily populated by afterpulses from the prompt
signal.
The modiﬁed LSV-delayed cut uses LSV
cluster-ﬁnding [7] to identify veto hits.
To count
as a likely neutron capture signal, the cluster is re-
quired to be >200 ns after the veto prompt time, to
have the number of PMTs contributing to the clus-
ter greater than that expected for afterpulses, and to
have an integral >100 PE, which includes the α + γ
capture peak for 10B [7] and captures on 1H and 12C.
The neutron eﬃciency for this restricted capture sig-
nal is calculated from 241Am13C data to be ∼0.79,
with most of the ineﬃciency coming from exclusion
of the 10B α-only capture peak and events from the
α + γ capture peak in which the γ ray escapes into
the cryostat. (None of these complications or eﬃ-
ciency losses apply to the actual neutron vetoing in
the WIMP search, which is done with simple inte-
grals over regions-of-interest – see Sec. V A 4.)
The selected neutron candidate events are shown
in Fig. 6, where we label neutron candidates that
fail the CosmicMu cut as “Cosmogenic”, and a spec-
tacular event with three neutron capture signals as
12
“Fission”. There is one observed radiogenic (α,n)
neutron in the WIMP-search region in the VPT
sample.
With an acceptance of 0.79 for the neu-
tron counting and a veto eﬃciency greater than
ϵdata
AmC = 0.9964 ± 0.0004, we predict a radiogenic
neutron background <0.005 events, with 100 % sta-
tistical error.
D.
Cosmogenic Neutrons
The rate of cosmogenic neutron background is
estimated via simulation using FLUKA (version
2011.2c) [38, 39]. The simulation is carried out in
multiple steps. In the ﬁrst and most time-consuming
step, cosmic-ray muons are started 7 m above the
ceiling of LNGS Hall C and propagated through the
7 m of rock. The muon and any produced secon-
daries are stopped and stored when they reach the
ceiling of Hall C [40]. The stored events are restarted
and propagated onto the WCV and are only pro-
cessed further if there are no muons entering the
water tank with energy >4 GeV and projected path
length in the water >2 m, since these would be re-
jected by the WCV. We ﬁnd that for a generated
livetime of 48.7 yr, the FLUKA simulation predicts
1388 events in which any particle reaches the TPC.
None of the 1388 events passes the simulated veto
cuts. Only one event is a single neutron in the TPC
with no other accompanying particles.
In 6 more
events, a neutron is accompanied by one other par-
ticle that is not an easily rejected muon, typically
a γ-ray or another neutron. None of these 7 events
have TPC energy deposits in our WIMP-search re-
gion.
If we take a 90% CL upper limit of 2.3 of 1388
events reaching the TPC passing the veto cuts and
take the 7 (neutron+≤1 particle) events as a conser-
vative upper limit on the number of neutron events
passing TPC cuts in 48.7 yr, we predict < 0.00035
cosmogenic neutron events passing all cuts in the
present WIMP search.
When we include the muons with long path
lengths and high energies in the WCV, the rate of
simulated single-scatter neutron events in the TPC
depositing energy in the WIMP search region rises
to ∼2 per year, in agreement with our count of 3
cosmogenic neutrons, shown in Fig. 6.
E.
Electron Recoil Backgrounds
With the PSD performance demonstrated in the
AAr run of DarkSide-50 [4] and the reduced rate
from the use of UAr [17], the most tenacious
ER background is mixed scintillation+Cherenkov
events. To estimate ER background surviving cuts,
a data/MC hybrid model was developed, which in-
corporates our GEANT4 simulation to model the γ-
ray kinematics and Cherenkov radiation while draw-
ing f90 from the AAr data.
A very large sample of Monte Carlo simulated
events, equivalent to about 90 live-years of data, was
generated. Statistics this large were needed to en-
sure that 0.05 events of ER background in our expo-
sure would be represented by at least 3 Monte Carlo
events. This was chosen so that, based on the 68%
C.L. interval constructed in [41], the statistical un-
certainty on the background prediction would be no
more than a factor of two. Events were generated
representing the decay chains and TPC components
listed in Table I. These were later normalized to the
activities in that Table and the accumulated live-
time of the WIMP-search data. To save on compu-
tation time, S1 photons for individual LAr scatters
are typically generated but not tracked. However,
for events with Cherenkov radiation, all photons –
including those from LAr scintillation, if there is an
accompanying scatter in the LAr – are generated and
tracked using optical parameters tuned on data [29].
Cherenkov light can be generated in the fused
silica PMT windows, the fused silica TPC win-
dows, and the Teﬂon reﬂectors surrounding the ac-
tive LAr volume. The optical parameters aﬀecting
the Cherenkov radiation and collection are adjusted
to match the observed “pure Cherenkov” events
in data, which are easily identiﬁed as single-pulse
events with f90 ≈1.0 (all prompt light).
A high-
statistics sample of pure Cherenkov events, enriched
in events with Cherenkov light generated in the
Teﬂon side reﬂector, was obtained using a 11.2 kBq
22Na source deployed next to the TPC cryostat. The
modeling of the generation of Cherenkov photons
and their collection by the PMTs was subsequently
validated against pure Cherenkov events from the
open UAr data set and from the 241Am-Be cali-
bration data, and the scintillation+Cherenkov back-
ground model was frozen.
The model constructs the f90 of a simulated
multiple-scatter event from the f90’s of its compo-
nent scatters. Energy depositions in the LAr with
a vertical separation <4.65 mm (motivated by stud-
ies using our electronics simulation) are merged to
model our S2 two-pulse resolution. Figure 7 shows
that f90 for unresolved multiple-scatter events is
higher than that of single-scatters with the same S1,
since mean ER f90 increases with decreasing S1. We
estimate that unresolved multiple-scatters are 3% of
ER events with 100 < S1 < 180 PE (the region
where this is estimated to have the most impact).
With a targeted background level of <0.1 event
in 532.4 live-days of data, we require reliable predic-

tions far out in the tail of the ER f90 distribution.
For this analysis, we do not extrapolate using an
analytic model ﬁt to data. Instead, we use our high-
statistics AAr data set [4], which is dominated by
uniformly distributed, single-sited ERs from
39Ar
β-decays, as the f90 probability distribution func-
tion. In particular, modeled single-scatter events in
the LAr (39Ar and 85Kr β-decays and single Comp-
ton scatters of γ rays) draw directly from the AAr
f90 vs. S1 distribution, unresolved multiple Comp-
ton scatter events draw multiple times, and scintil-
lation+Cherenkov events have their scintillation S1
and f90 augmented with the Cherenkov light pre-
dicted by the G4DS model, treating the Cherenkov
radiation as entirely prompt.
The available AAr
statistics, which represent about 15 years-worth of
single-scatter events in UAr running, are suﬃcient,
given the randomization that occurs when the scin-
tillation f90’s are combined with Cherenkov light.
ER background with Cherenkov light radiated in
the fused silica PMT and TPC windows results in
abnormally large amounts of light concentrated in
individual PMTs. As shown in Fig. 7, the S1 prompt
maximum fraction cut, S1pMaxFrac, is very eﬀective
against fused-silica Cherenkov, leaving Cherenkov in
the Teﬂon, primarily the cylindrical side wall of the
TPC, as the dominant ER background.
Attempts to ﬁnd cuts eﬀective against scintilla-
tion+Teﬂon Cherenkov events were only modestly
successful. A major motivation for introducing a ra-
dial ﬁducial cut was its observed impact on high-f90
events in the open data, as discussed below.
Some cuts are diﬃcult or impossible to apply to
modeled events, so their impact in the search region
is hard to estimate. These include cuts based on S2,
which was too costly in computation time to fully

simulate in the large Monte Carlo sample, and cuts
based on detector foibles like the surface background
cuts discussed in Sec. V B. Although they are applied
to the data, we do not include potential rejection
from the S2/S1 cut, the NLL cut, and the surface
background cuts in our ER background estimate.
Final testing of the model was carried out by un-
blinding various test samples. These samples are of
two types. The ﬁrst type consists of samples cre-
ated by inverting an established analysis cut, giving
events already tagged as background. The second
type consists of regions with small WIMP accep-
tance, outside any plausible ﬁnal f90 vs. S1 box, but
inside our (initially generous) blinding box.
The ﬁrst of these tests uses the Veto Prompt Tag
sample described in Sec. V C. The number of neu-
trons in this sample was found to be small, and they
are identiﬁed and removed. While the VPT allows us
to look in the WIMP search region without compro-
mising blindness, the statistics are low. We instead
test the model in pre-deﬁned regions near the search
region with higher statistics, still dominated by scin-
tillation+Teﬂon Cherenkov events.
Agreement in
number of events between the data and model in
these regions is within two statistical standard devi-
ations. Figure 8 shows the data-model agreement in
the f90 spectrum.
In the ﬁnal tests, we open two regions in the
f90 vs. S1 plot, regions A and B in Fig. 9, af-
ter applying the LSVprompt cut and all the TPC
cuts other than the radial, NLL, S2/S1, and sur-
face background cuts.
From the model, we ex-
pect these regions to be dominated by scintilla-
tion+Teﬂon Cherenkov events. Table III shows the
data-model comparisons for the two test regions,
with the model normalized to the data livetime. The
ﬁrst to be opened was region A. As can be seen in
Table III, the data and model in region A disagree

at about the three-standard-deviation level statisti-
cally.
Region B was designed and opened shortly after
observing the data/model discrepancy in region A to
supplement the available data statistics. As can be
seen in Table III, the observed and predicted region
B event counts are in agreement, albeit with poor
statistics.
We choose to combine the statistics in regions A
and B, and interpret the observed discrepancy be-
tween the data and model—a factor of 1.5—as a
measure of the model’s systematic error.
Accord-
ingly, we scale the model’s output up by the same
factor when making our ER background prediction.
The observed data events in regions A and B are
also used to estimate the rejection of our radial ﬁdu-
cialization. After the remaining cuts not used in Ta-
ble III are applied, there are 30 events, of which 13
survive the radial cut. From this a rejection factor
of (2.3±0.5) is inferred and applied to the model’s
prediction. Hence, to design the ﬁnal WIMP search
box, we multiply the model background by 1.5/2.3.
Consistent with previous analyses, we ﬁx the right

edge of the WIMP box at S1=460 PE. The pres-
ence of pure Cherenkov events in the data suggests
that having a search box extending all the way to
f90 = 1, as in past analyses, is unnecessarily risky,
so we choose to put the upper edge of the box at
f90 = 0.84, which is approximately the contour that
excludes 1% of NR. At high S1, the background
studies support a lower f90 boundary than used in
previous analyses – we ﬁx it along a curve that
our latest calculations show to be approximately
the 99% NR acceptance contour.
At low S1, the
box’s lower boundary is determined by the desired
total predicted background in the box (0.1 events in
our case), and in particular, the ER backgrounds.
With near-ﬁnal estimates of the other backgrounds
in hand, we allocated 0.08 background events to
the ER backgrounds; the corresponding lower box
boundary is drawn according to this requirement.
In previous DarkSide analyses [4, 17], analytical
models of f90 ﬂuctuations were ﬁt to data in bins
of S1, and the resulting functions were used to set
a boundary that admitted equal background in each
bin. Adding Cherenkov light to the mix invalidates
that procedure. We use the ER background model
described above for this purpose, but we do not have
adequate Monte Carlo statistics for bin-by-bin as-
sessment. Instead, the determination of the bound-
ary is done in two steps. 1) The rough shape of the
boundary is determined where Monte Carlo statis-
tics are available, by ﬁnding the f90 that gives 0.07
leakage events in each 5 PE bin, about 14 times
the ﬁnal target background. A polynomial is ﬁt to
these points. 2) The ﬁtted curve is translated up-
ward in f90 until the box deﬁned by its intersection
with the other bounds contains ≤0.08 events of ER
background. In practice this was driven by 7 Monte
Carlo events, to which we attached an uncertainty
of ±50% by the construction in [41].
This is the
dominant uncertainty on the predicted ER and to-
tal background estimates.

cept the ﬁducial cuts and the ﬁnal f90 vs. S1 WIMP
search box is given in Table V [35]. With the excep-
tion of purely accidental losses such as those from
the veto cuts, acceptances are measured with NR
events from the 241AmBe calibration data, corrected
for spatial non-uniformity when necessary. Several
of the cuts have non-negligible S1 dependence. In
these cases, the full S1-dependent acceptance (see
Fig. 10) is used to calculate the sensitivity of the
analysis, and the Table-V entry is an average value.
The impact of the ﬁducial cuts on sensitivity are
counted in the ﬁducial mass. The eﬀect of the tdrift
cut, unchanged from previous analyses, is calculated
from the geometry and drift velocity.
The accep-
tance of the RadialFid cut (see Fig. 5) requires spe-
cial treatment because of our lack of an absolute cal-
ibration for the x-y reconstruction and because it is
in principle S1 dependent via the S2-dependent x-y
resolution. We use the fact that 39Ar events are uni-
formly distributed like WIMP scatters and 241AmBe
events have NR S2/S1 like WIMP scatters to de-
termine the acceptance in two steps. 1) The cut’s
acceptance vs. S2 is estimated using 39Ar events in
our AAr data, which are uniformly distributed. 2)
Acceptance vs. NR S1 is then estimated by using
S2/S1 as measured in our 241AmBe data to look up
acceptance in the corresponding AAr S2 bin. Av-
eraged over S1 in the WIMP selection region, the
acceptance of this cut (after the drift time ﬁducial-
ization) is 0.848 ± 0.002, varying by less than 0.5%
with S1.
(This S1 dependence is included in the
sensitivity calculation.)
The ﬁnal ﬁducial mass is
(31.3 ± 0.5) kg, with most of the uncertainty coming
from the uncertainty in the thermal contraction of
the Teﬂon reﬂector.
The f90 acceptance vs. S1 is determined from the
f90 parametrization as described in Sec. II B. Fig-
ure 10 shows acceptance vs. S1 for the analysis cuts.
Having designed a box to achieve our background
target using cuts with understood acceptance, we
proceeded to unblinding.

shown in the table was chosen to be informative.
Each of the last two events in Table V was cut by
both the prompt and delayed veto cuts. They are

WIMP SENSITIVITY AND LIMIT
A limit on spin-independent DM-nucleon scat-
tering is derived assuming the standard isothermal
WIMP halo model, with vescape = 544 km/ sec [42],
v0 = 220 km/ sec [42], vEarth = 232 km/ sec [43], and
ρDM = 0.3 GeV/(c2 cm3) [44].
The background-
and signal-free result is consistent with up to 2.3
DM-induced scatters (90 % C.L.), which sets an
upper limit on the spin-independent DM-nucleon
cross-section at 1.14 × 10−44 cm2 (3.78 × 10−44 cm2,
3.43 × 10−43 cm2)
for
100 GeV/c2
(1 TeV/c2,
10 TeV/c2) DM particles.
The minimum upper
limit is 1.09 × 10−44 cm2 at 126 GeV/c2. Figure 12
compares this limit to those obtained by other
experiments.
Figure 13 demonstrates available improvements in
background rejection, which we do not use in this
analysis. If we require S2/S1 lower than the median
value for nuclear recoils and also radial ﬁducializa-
tion to about 8 cm from the wall (r < 10 cm), we ob-
tain an even greater separation between the events
surviving the selection and the previously deﬁned

Spin-independent DM-nucleon cross section
90 % C.L. exclusion limits from the analysis detailed
in this paper, compared to our previous result [17]
and selected results from other experiments using ar-
gon (WARP [45], DEAP-3600 [2]) and xenon (LUX [46],
XENON1T [1], PandaX-II [47]).
DM search region. In a multi-tonne detector [48],
these cuts would provide exceptional background re-
jection at the cost of an aﬀordable loss in detection
eﬃciency.
