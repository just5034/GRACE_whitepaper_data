    "reasoning": "This workflow systematically addresses the DarkSide-50 dark matter detector analysis by first extracting design specifications from the paper, then implementing a comprehensive simulation study. The workflow includes both electronic and nuclear recoil simulations at dark matter relevant energies (0.1-5 MeV), characterizes detector performance through light yield and discrimination measurements, optimizes PMT coverage within computational constraints, and validates improvements. Each simulation step is followed by dedicated analysis and visualization steps to provide evidence-based results. The workflow respects the FAIR DATE paradigm by extracting only design specifications and discovering performance through simulation rather than reading measured results from the paper."
