It starts with a baseline planar detector, progresses to cylindrical barrel geometry for better angular coverage, then optimizes thickness to minimize material budget and spacing to improve momentum resolution. Each configuration is simulated with muons across the full momentum range (1-50 GeV/c) and analyzed for energy deposits, detection efficiency, and material budget. The workflow includes mandatory visualization steps after each analysis and concludes with comprehensive performance comparison and design recommendations.
